I am a new PhD student and member of the [Parallel and Distributed Systems](https://www.uni-muenster.de/PVS/en/index.html) group at the [University of MÃ¼nster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/en/) in Germany.
During my master thesis I started working on automated optimization and code generation for parallel systems.
I will continue to work on this topic in close cooperation with the Universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow in the context of the [Lift Project](https://www.lift-project.org/).

You can find my CV on [GitHub](https://github.com/bastian-koepcke/cv/blob/master/koepcke_cv.pdf).
